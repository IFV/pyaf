While issue reports are always welcome, and you are free to use any form to submit these, the following points are to be considered for an easier processing and more productivity:

1. The issue must be a bug or a feature request.
2. A description is needed as source code and/or a link to a dataset for which the problem arises (please simplify the code, anonymize the dataset etc).
3. information on different software versions used (pyaf, numpy, pandas, scikit-learn etc). The output of the following script should be enough : https://github.com/antoinecarme/pyaf/blob/master/tests/basic_checks/platform_info.py
